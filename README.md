# Recipes

This was recipes, the [*first project*](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) within the Odin Project curriculum. This was an assignment designed to make students practice the basics of HTML and CSS knowledge acquired.

In this recipes project, I incorporated basic CSS styling and utilised the foundations of HTML to create linked pages.
